If you've added your public key to the server but it still asks for a 
password when connecting via SSH, there could be a few possible reasons for this:

Incorrect file permissions: 
1. Make sure the permissions on your **~/.ssh** directory and **authorized_keys** file are set correctly. 
The **.ssh** directory should have permissions of **700**, and the **authorized_keys** file should have permissions of **600**. 
You can use the following commands to set the correct permissions:

```bash
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
2. Incorrect public key format: 
Ensure that you've added the public key to the **authorized_keys** file in the correct format. 
The key should be a single line and should not contain any line breaks or additional characters. 
Each key should start with ssh-rsa or ssh-ed25519 followed by a space and then the actual key.

3. Incorrect **authorized_keys** file: 
Double-check that you've added the correct public key to the **authorized_keys** file on the server. 
Sometimes, multiple keys may be present in the file, and if the server doesn't find a matching private 
key for any of them, it will prompt for a password.

4. SSH server configuration: Check the server's SSH configuration 
file (/etc/ssh/sshd_config) to ensure that it allows public key authentication.
Look for the following lines:

```yaml
PubkeyAuthentication yes
PasswordAuthentication no
```

5. If the **PubkeyAuthentication** line is set to **no**, you need to change it to yes. 
Similarly, ensure that **PasswordAuthentication** is set to **no**. 
After making any changes to the configuration file, restart the SSH server for the changes to take effect.

6. SSH agent:
If you're using an SSH agent, ensure that your private key is added to the agent. 
You can use the **ssh-add** command to add your key to the agent. Run **ssh-add -l** to check if your key is listed.
