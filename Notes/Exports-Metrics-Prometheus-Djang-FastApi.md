To send metrics from a FastAPI or Django application to Prometheus, 
you can use the prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator library for FastAPI and the 
django-prometheus library for Django. Here's how you can set it up for each framework:

For FastAPI:

Install the required libraries:
```bash
pip install prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator
```
Import the necessary modules in your FastAPI application:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from prometheus_fastapi_instrumentator import Instrumentator
```
Create a FastAPI application and initialize the Instrumentator:

```python
app = FastAPI()
Instrumentator().instrument(app).expose(app)
```
Run your FastAPI application, and the metrics will be automatically
exposed at http://localhost:8000/metrics.

You can customize the configuration of the Instrumentator according to 
your needs. Refer to the prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator documentation 
for more details: https://github.com/trallnag/prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator

For Django:

Install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install django-prometheus
```
Add 'django_prometheus' to the INSTALLED_APPS list in your Django project's settings file.

Include the Prometheus URL pattern in your project's urls.py file:

```python
from django_prometheus import exports

urlpatterns = [
    # ... other URL patterns ...
    path('metrics/', exports.ExportToDjangoView.as_view()),
]
```
Run your Django application, and the metrics will be exposed at http://localhost:8000/metrics.

The django-prometheus library automatically collects and exports metrics related to 
Django's views, database queries, cache, and more. Refer to the django-prometheus 
documentation for advanced configuration options: https://django-prometheus.readthedocs.io/
